# A Guide to Securing Your First Co-Op

## What To Do Over Break
* Update Your Resume
    * Refer to my resume for a general template.
    * I'd recommend using AI sites to optimize your bullets with keywords relevant to the positions you're applying for.
    * This will put you in a great position to be cleared ASAP.
* Make/Update Your LinkedIn
    * Refer to my LinkedIn for a general template.
* Ensure Your Resume & LinkedIn Are Synced With Each Other
* Work on a Personal Project
    * More details in my advice.
* Prepare Answers To Interview Questions
    * Try to come up with answers for the questions I list below. These questions are very common so it would very beneficial to be able to answer them by heart. Once you've gotten that down, you can work on incorporating firm & position specific details into your responses.
* LeetCode
    * Try to do 1-2 a day. 
    * More details in my advice.

## What To Do When the Semester Starts
* Schedule Your Clearance Meeting & TA Resume Review for ASAP
    * If you get cleared earlier, you can be the first to apply. If you're the first to apply, you'll be the first to interview. If you're the first to interview, you'll be the first to be offered. Starting the process early can give you a big advantage not only in terms of offering, but also gaining interview experience.
* Once You're Cleared, Spam Apply
    * Ideally 50+ initially. Remember, applying to co-ops & jobs isn't like college. Companies aren't obligated to follow-up on your application so it's in your best interest to cast your net as wide as possible.
* Check NUWorks Frequently
    * Try to check back at least once a week after your initial spam of applications since companies will post more co-ops as the semester goes on.

## Interviews

All the behavioral questions I've been asked:
* General
    * Tell me about yourself.
    * Walk me through your resume.
    * Why [your major]?
        * For combined majors, why [combined major 1] ***and*** [combined major 2]?
    * Why Northeastern?
    * Tell me about a time when you worked in in a team.
    * Tell me about a time where you disagreed with a team member. How did your resolve this?
    * Tell me about a time where you had to learn something new. How did you go about it?
    * Why this company/firm?
    * Tell me about a time where you had to review someone else’s code. How did you approach it?
* CS
    * Why CS?
    * Walk me through all the languages on your resume. Tell me about your experience in each.
    * What is your favorite programming language? Why? What is your favorite feature? What are some pros and cons?
    * Tell me about [project on your resume].

Ensure you have at least 3 questions prepared for each interview. When the interview is coming to an end, they will turn it over to you for questions. Try to have 2 template questions where you can substitute the company's name in and 1 question very specific to this company. You're trying to get the interviewer to hit you with a "good question".

## Coding Challenges

One part about the search for CS/related fields is the coding challenges. I got lots of these take-home challenges and from my experience they were easy-medium questions. Topics I ran into were basic algorithms & optimization (take this function from O(n^2) to O(n), simple DP) and data structures (Maps/Dictionaries, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Trees, Graphs). Generally, the hardest part is figuring out what the question is asking. Once you know what they're looking for the code is short & sweet. For these I would just recommend setting some time aside and getting it over with. Ideally try to solve all the questions with additional test cases that go beyond what you're given, descriptive commenting, and accounting for edge cases. Keep in mind these are just a prescreening tool to thin down the applicant pool before conducting interviews; so while it isn't the end of the world if you don't pass all test cases, aim to have at least 75% of their test cases passing so you don't get weeded out.

## Advice

* Avoid Comparing Yourself To Others
    * While your friends & classmates can be a good gauge of progression through the process, remember everyone has different experiences, levels of comfort in interviews, perspectives they can bring to a team, among many other things. The upsides of comparing yourself to others are limited while the downsides can be much worse, hurting your mental health and putting strain on relationships. Instead of spending time thinking about how X did Y, you're better than X at Z, and you did "all" the work on the your project with X, focus on making yourself the best possible candidate.
* Leverage Your Offers, Even If They're "Unrelated"
    * I had gone on a 2 week stretch of daily interviews and was waiting to hear back from those places. I then got fast tracked to the final round for a business analyst role. The interview went great, however, the role wasn't quite what I was looking for as it was mainly excel based work as opposed to coding. However, I used that offer to reach out to the firms I was still waiting to hear back from. Did they know it was a BA offer and not a SWE offer? No, but they knew that there existed a competing offer. As a result of this email, I received a call with an offer the next morning! I ended up accepting this offer since it was what I wanted, intersection of CS & econ and a more competitive compensation package. Rejection & waiting to hear back can be rough, but all that will be nullified when your hard work pays off and you get an offer. 
* Personal Projects
    * Even if it's simple, make it something related to your areas of interest and learn at least 1 new language/tool/framework. You just want something that differentiates yourself because all the other co-op resumes they're reviewing & eventually interviewing have the same Fundies/OOD/DS class projects.
* Interview Language
    * Pick a general purpose language you will interview in and stick with it. Do all your interview prep, coding challenges, and technical interviews in this language. Over time you will pick up little bits of syntactic sugar which will optimize your interviewing. My personal preference was Python since it required less boilerplate, was more readable which made it easier to explain, and had a lot of built in features.
* LeetCode
    * In your interview language, be able to do the easies within 10-15 min while explaining, commenting, testing, and identifying edge cases. First co-op live codes typically won’t go beyond this level of difficulty. 

# Best of Luck!
